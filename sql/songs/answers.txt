1.Aura of the person with 100 songs in songs.db might be Purple. Because of their relatively
  high energy and danceability and low valence
2.There are only three factors to calculate aura with current algorithm and I think it is low.
  In addition, we may calculate different levels of energy, valence and danceability and measure
  which kind of levels of these aura factors were more frequent in songs. This might give us more clear
  picture.
